                We write recipes, among other things, for a living. It may seem easy, but it isn't always. It takes practice and adherence to a few rules.
Knowing how to write a recipe is something even an amateur cook can benefit from knowing. Especially when it comes to entering our contests... (hint hint).

There are two main parts of a recipe, the Ingredient List and the Preparation Method. I'll take you through some basic guidelines for writing both parts.
<p></p>
This is our own style guide and loose list of rules. Of course, there are endless exceptions and little side-rules. There are also styles that certain publications use that you may be used to and that may be different from what we present here. If you have a question that isn't addressed in the below guidelines, please ask in the comments.
<p></p>
Before the ingredients, comes the title, number of servings and serving size if appropriate. Then the ingredient list and the preparation method. If the recipes is adapted from another recipe, a credit is due ("Adapted from Dorie Greenspan's World Peace Cookies") below the text of the method.
<p></p>
<h3> The Ingredient Lists </h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href='recepta/1'>Pancake Ingredients</a>
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
<a href='recepta/2'>Donuts Ingredients</a>
</li>
<p></p>
<li>
<a href='recepta/3'>Cakey Ingredients</a>
</li>
<p></p>
</ul>
If the recipe has different elements (a pie, for example has a crust, a filling), break up the ingredient list with headings such as "Crust" and "Filling."
<p></p>
When several ingredients are used at the same time (in the case of baking, often all the dry ingredients are sifted or mixed together at once), list them in descending order according to volume. If there is an issue over preparation, list in order, so for example if you need the zest and juice of a lemon, list the zest first and then the juice since that is the order you will do the preparation.
<p></p>
Do not use two numerals together. You need to set off the second number in parenthesis. This comes up with sizes of packages. For example, "1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese."
<p></p>
If an ingredient begins with a letter instead of a number, freshly ground black pepper, for example, capitalize the first letter, as in "Freshly ground black pepper."
<p></p>
If the preparation of an ingredient is simple, place that technique in the ingredient list, as in "2 eggs, beaten" or "1 stick butter, softened."
